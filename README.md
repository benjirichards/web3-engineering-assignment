To run deploy the contracts and update the contract address on line 15 of index.js
Next, from the root directory run:
    node index.js
Now the app is up and running.

I was unable to finish the full implmentation due to time constraints and learning how to build my first cli. I believe that in another hour or so I would have had the application working fully.
